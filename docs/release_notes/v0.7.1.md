# Release 0.7.1

## ⚠️ Notice: Breaking Changes ⚠️

This release contains breaking changes to the Custom Resources for the following objects:

- Configuration
- Localization
- Resource

The following resource has been added:
- FluxDeployer

These changes have been implemented in order to bring consistency across the APIs for all `ocm-controller` Custom Resources.

Please check out the guides on our website to see how the new workflow looks:

- [Deploying Application with OCM & GitOps](https://ocm.software/docs/guides/deploying-applications-with-ocm-and-gitops/)
- [Air-gapped GitOps with OCM & Flux](https://ocm.software/docs/guides/air-gapped-gitops-with-ocm-and-flux/)
- [GitOps Driven Configuration of OCM Applications](https://ocm.software/docs/guides/gitops-driven-configuration-of-ocm-applications/)

The primary takeway is that it is now no longer necessary for users to concern themselves with managing snapshots.

- Extracting Snapshot Writing Code (#188)
- Fix Kubectl Printer Columns (#185)

Finally, we've put in place an end-to-end test suite for the `ocm-contoller`.
