## ⚠️ Notice: Breaking Changes ⚠️

This release contains breaking changes to the Custom Resources for the following objects:

- Configuration
- Localization
- Resource

The following resource has been added:
- FluxDeployer

These changes have been implemented in order to bring consistency across the APIs for all `ocm-controller` Custom Resources.

Please check out the guides on our website to see how the new workflow looks:
